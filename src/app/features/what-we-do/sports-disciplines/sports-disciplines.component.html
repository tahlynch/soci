        without holing the shot, the player shall record a score of “10x” and proceed to the next hole. In the place of a
        tie for first place, the winner can be decided (when a playoff is not feasible) by the number of “10x” scores on
        an athlete’s scorecard. The player with the fewest number of “10x” scores shall be declared the winner.
